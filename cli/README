0.  Prerequisites.
==================

Before being able to reach your bank via EBICS, please
make sure that you activated your 'subscriber', and obtained
the credentials from your bank!

1.  How to launch the Nexus.
============================
From the top directory of this Git repository (on a GNU/Linux system):
    
    ./gradlew nexus:run


2.  How to use the CLI to request your transactions history.
============================================================

1.  Once you obtained your credentials, you need to "store"
  them into the Nexus.  After launching the Nexus (see #1),
  give the command:
    
    libeufin-cli ebics new-subscriber \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-choose> \
      --ebics-url=<URL serving EBICS requests, your bank should have notified you one> \
      --user-id=<EBICS specific user id, see your credentials> \
      --partner-id=<EBICS specific partner id, see your credentials> \
      --host-id=<EBICS specific token identifying the EBICS server, see your credentials> \
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL

2.  To upload your keys to the bank, and download the bank's.
    
    libeufin-cli ebics prepare --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1>


3 (recommended).  To get a backup of your EBICS keys:
    
    libeufin ebics backup \
        --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1> \
        --output-file=<path to where to store the backup>

5.  You can now ask for the transactions history concerning your
  EBICS subscriber.
    
    libeufin ebics c52 --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1>


3.  Instructions to issue a payment instruction.
================================================

1.  Link your bank accounts to your EBICS subscriber.

    libeufin-cli ebics fetch-accounts \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1-of-2> \
      --prepare \ # shortcut to upload your keys at the bank, and download the bank's
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL

2.  To see all of your bank accounts that are known to the Nexus.

    libeufin-cli ebics bank-accounts \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1-of-2> \
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL

3.  Prepare the payment.

    libeufin-cli ebics prepare-payment \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1-of-2> \
      --creditor-iban=<IBAN from the bank account that is receiving the payment> \
      --creditor-bic=<BIC from the bank account that is receiving the payment> \
      --creditor-name=<real name of the legal entity associated with the creditor IBAN> \
      --subject=<subject line associated with the money transfer> \
      --sum=<amount of money to transfer, in the form X[.YY] (no currency specified.  Always EUR)> \
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL

4.  If the previous step succeeded, then the Nexus can be triggered to process the
    pending payment(s), *regardless* of which customer prepared them.  This step will
    be automated in the future, and only needed now to help debugging.

    libeufin-cli ebics execute-payments $NEXUS_BASE_URL
