1.  How to launch the Nexus.
============================
From the top directory of this Git repository (on a GNU/Linux system):
    
    ./gradlew nexus:run


2.  How to use the CLI to request your transactions history.
============================================================

1.  *Before* executing the CLI, you need EBICS credentials
  from your bank.

2.  Once you obtained your credentials, you need to "store"
  them into the Nexus.  After launching the Nexus (see #1),
  give the command:
    
    libeufin-cli ebics new-subscriber \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-choose> \
      --ebics-url=<URL serving EBICS requests, your bank should have notified you one> \
      --user-id=<EBICS specific user id, see your credentials> \
      --partner-id=<EBICS specific partner id, see your credentials> \
      --host-id=<EBICS specific token identifying the EBICS server, see your credentials> \
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL

3.  To upload your keys to the bank, and download the bank's.
    
    libeufin-cli ebics prepare --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-1>


4 (recommended).  To get a backup of your EBICS keys:
    
    libeufin ebics backup \
        --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-2> \
        --output-file=<path to where to store the backup>

5.  You can now ask for the transactions history concerning your
  EBICS subscriber.
    
    libeufin ebics c52 --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-2>


3.  Further information
=======================

1.  To link your bank accounts to your EBICS subscriber.

    libeufin-cli ebics fetch-accounts \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-2> \
      --prepare \ # shortcut to upload your keys at the bank, and download the bank's
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL

2 To see all of your bank accounts that are known to the Nexus.

    libeufin-cli ebics bank-accounts \
      --account-id=<mnemonic-token-you-chose-at-step-2> \
      $NEXUS_BASE_URL
