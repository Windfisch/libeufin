This is NOT a 'clean' Debian package.

The DH build process with gradle passes "--offline" to Gradle and thus
does not work with the libeufin build system.

Invoking the libeufin build system directly without the DH-magic
results in some failures to create a lock file in /root/ by Gradle.

Java builds are a mess.


So to still generate a 'nice' Debian package, you
must run:

$ ./gradlew dist
$ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b -uc -us

Basically, we take the 'binary' zip file generated by the first
command as the "source" for dpkg.  Yuckkee!
