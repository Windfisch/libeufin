The sandox must be exported as JAR in order to be run.
The following command exports the JAR in GNU/Linux systems.

$ cd <this repository>
$ ./gradlew jar

If the previous step worked, then a new JAR file should
be located under <this repository>/build/libs/sandbox-$VERSION.jar,
where $VERSION reflects the value of the 'version' global
variable from <this repository>/build.gradle.

The following command runs the sandbox:

$ java -jar <this repository>/build/libs/sandbox-$VERSION.jar

MS Windows users.
=================
The steps to follow are the same as in GNU/Linux systems, except
that the command "gradlew.bat jar" would produce the JAR file.
