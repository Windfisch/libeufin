Installing LibEuFin
===================

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$PFX
$ make install

If the previous step succeeded, libeufin-nexus and a
command line client (libeufin-cli) should be found under
$PFX/bin.

Conversely, the Sandbox needs to be explicitly installed,
with the following command:

$ make install-sandbox

If the previous command succeeded, libeufin-sandbox
should be found under $PFX/bin as well.

Setup PostgreSQL access
=======================

Libeufin connects to a PostgreSQL instance via TCP.  In
order to keep the development light, the password authentication
should be disabled on the local machine.

The first step is to (1) locate the file pg_hba.conf.  In
debian systems, this is usually located under "/etc/postgresql/$VERSION/main/".

Then (2) add the following rules to it:

    # allows libeufin to connect password-less.  NOTE: it might be
    # important to keep the following two lines before the third line
    # showed in this snippet.
    
    host   libeufintestdb         libeufin   127.0.0.1/32          trust
    host   libeufindb             libeufin   127.0.0.1/32          trust
    # IPv4 local connections:
    host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            md5

(3) Create the databases "libeufintestdb" and "libeufindb"
(4) Create the role "libeufin"
(5) Restart the database

If the configuration was successful, the following command should
access the "libeufin" database without asking for a password:

    $ psql -U libeufin -h 127.0.0.1 -d libeufindb

If 'psql' could not find the right port to connect, consider using
the "-p $PG_PORT" option.

Launching LibEuFin
==================

Try the command

    $ libeufin-$SERVICE

where SERVICE equals either 'nexus' or 'sandbox'.
