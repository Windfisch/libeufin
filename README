Installing LibEuFin
===================

$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure --prefix=$PFX
$ make install

If the previous step succeeded, libeufin-nexus and a
command line client (libeufin-cli) should be found under
$PFX/bin.

Conversely, the Sandbox needs to be explicitly installed,
with the following command:

$ make install-sandbox

If the previous command succeeded, libeufin-sandbox
should be found under $PFX/bin as well.

Launching LibEuFin
==================

Try the command

    $ libeufin-$SERVICE

where SERVICE equals either 'nexus' or 'sandbox'.
